This line graph delineates the evolution of data science salaries in the USA from 2020 to 2024, segmented by work model: hybrid, on-site, and remote. Initially, on-site positions commanded the highest salaries, but over time, they saw a decline, eventually aligning with remote positions, which remained relatively stable throughout the period. Hybrid roles, represented by the yellow line, witnessed a decline in 2020 and continued to earn lower salaries compared to the other work models. The persistence of lower salaries for hybrid roles could reflect market dynamics or preferences for fully on-site or remote arrangements. The data underscores a significant shift in the data science landscape, where remote work model is not only becoming more prevalent but also increasingly competitive in terms of compensation. This trend reflects the broader changes in work dynamics and the growing flexibility in the technology sector.
